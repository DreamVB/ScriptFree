# Script-Free
A new stack based scripting language in the starting.

Script-Free is my personal project I am working on it started as a small RPN calculator but added some features used in Forth and it will also some other features as it continues to grow.

# What I have so far

- Works with most operators that you see in a calculator and includes many built in functions.
- Allows for working with 26 single letter variables.
- Allows you to use # as comments in the script file.
- Can use print to output anything on top of the stack.
- Can print single chars but you must assign their char value.
# Things I like to add

- Get rid of the use of single letter variables and allow for any name
- Add other script features like Jumps, If Then Else, Loops
- Add more math functions
- Allow for printing strings
